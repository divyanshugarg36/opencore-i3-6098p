### Description:-
This is the guide which was used to make this hackintosh work [Opencore][d-o-g]. As a simple advise i would like to tell if you are planning to build your own hackintosh just go through the guide first, read it with full concentration and do only what is written there. This guide lists everything from the hardware requirement specifications to boot, installation, errors and debugging, post-installation and tricks.
This opencore guide also has a bootable USB disk tutorial which is basically a web installer and in case you are going for catalina it will download 8.XX GB minimum, so if you dont trust you network or your network sucks then prefer full opencore usb guide which is mention here [DoesPrintfWork Offline Installer Guide][offline-installer] (This is to avoid frustuation because of network because if network fluctuates the installer will fail with error 8). This method specifically requires macOS or Windows 10 so use accordingly. [MakeInstallmacOS][other-file] is required for the offline installer method. This will simply speedup the installation process.
